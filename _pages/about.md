I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Robotics and Autonomous Systems with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at Arizona State University. Previously, I completed my Integrated Master’s of Technology in Computer Science from the University of Hyderabad.

In my professional journey, I have combined my expertise in AI, machine learning, and distributed systems to develop impactful solutions. At Infiheal, I worked as an AI Software Engineer, where I played a key role in advancing emotional analysis for a mental health chatbot. I implemented advanced web scraping techniques and optimized deep learning models, significantly improving classification accuracy and development efficiencies.

Additionally, I worked at Siddhi Systems Inc.(Remote),Texas,USA, contributing to various projects ranging from software development to machine learning, cloud data processing, and data science. My work spanned distributed computing, large-scale data engineering, and model optimization, leading to enhanced system performance and streamlined workflows.
